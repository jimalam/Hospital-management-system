Indenting and Line Length - Use an indent of 4 spaces and don't use any tab because 
different computers use different setting for tab. It is recommended to keep lines at 
approximately 75-85 characters long for better code readability.

Control Structures - These include if, for, while, switch, etc. Control
 statements should have one space between the control keyword and opening parenthesis,
 to distinguish them from function calls. You are strongly encouraged to
 always use curly braces even in situations where they are technically optional.
